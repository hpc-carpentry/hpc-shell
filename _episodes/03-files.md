Now that we know how to move around and look at things, let's learn how to read, write, and handle files!
We'll start by moving back to our home directory:

```
$ cd ~
```
{: .bash}

What if we want to make a file? 
There are a few ways of doing this, the easiest of which is simply using a text editor. 
For this lesson, we are going to us `nano`, since it's super easy to use.

To use `nano` on a file, simply type `nano filename`. If the file does not exist, it will be created. 
`^O` (ctrl + O) saves the file, and `^X` quits. 
If you have not saved your file upon trying to quit, it will ask you if you want to save.

> ## Using `vim` as a text editor
> From time to time, you may encounter the `vim` text editor.
> Although `vim` isn't the easiest or most user-friendly of text editors, 
> you'll be able to find it on any system and it has many more features than `nano`.
>
> `vim` has several modes, a "command" mode (for doing big operations, like saving and quitting) 
> and an "insert" mode. You can switch to insert mode with the `i` key, and command mode with `Esc`.
>
> In insert mode, you can type more or less normally. In command mode there are a few commands you should be aware of:
>
> * `:q!` - quit, without saving
> * `:wq` - save and quit
> * `dd` - cut/delete a line
> * `y` - paste a line
{: .callout}

Let's make a new file now, type whatever you want in it, and save it.

```
nano test.txt
```
{: .bash}

Do a quick check to confirm our file was created.
```
$ ls
```
{: .bash}
```
test.txt
```
{: .output}

Let's read our file now. There are a few different ways of doing this, the simplest of which is simply reading the entire file with `cat`.

```
$ cat test.txt
```
{: .bash}
```
This is the contents of our test file.
```
{: .output}

Although `cat` may not seem like an intuitive command with which to open files, it stands for "concatenate"- giving it multiple arguments will print out one file followed by the contents of the next, and so on.

```
$ cat test.txt test.txt
```
{: .bash}
```
This is the contents of our test file.
This is the contents of our test file.
```
{: .output}

We've successfully created a file. What about a directory? We've actually done this before, using `mkdir`.
```
$ mkdir files
$ ls
```
{: .bash}

## Moving and copying files

To practice moving files, we will move `test.txt` to that directory with `mv` (move). `mv`'s syntax is relatively simple, and works for both files and directories `mv <file/directory> <path to new location>`

```
$ mv test.txt files
$ cd files
$ ls
```
{: .bash}
```
test.txt
```
{: .output}

`test.txt` isn't a very descriptive name. How do we go about changing it?

It turns out that the way to rename files and folders is with `mv` again.
Although this may not seem intuitive at first, think of it as moving a file
to be stored under a different name. The syntax is quite similar to moving
files: `mv oldName newName`.

```
$ mv test.txt newname.testfile
$ ls
```
{: .bash}
```
newname.testfile
```
{: .output}

> ## File extensions are arbitrary
>
> In the last example, we changed both a file's name and extension at the same time. 
> On UNIX systems, file extensions (like `.txt`) are arbitrary. 
> A file is a `.txt` file only because we say it is. 
> Changing the name or extension of the file will *never* change a file's contents, 
> so you are free to rename things as you wish.
> With that in mind, however, 
> file extensions are a useful tool for keeping track of what type of data it contains.
> A `.txt` file typically contains text, for instance.
{: .callout}

What if we want to copy a file, instead of simply renaming or moving it? 
Use `cp` (an abbreviated name for "copy"). 
This command has to different uses that work in the same way as `mv`:

* Copy to same directory (copied file is renamed): `cp file newFilename`

* Copy to other directory (copied file retains original name): `cp file directory`

Let's try this out.
```
$ cp newname.testfile copy.testfile
$ ls
$ cp newname.testfile ..
$ cd ..
$ ls
```
{: .bash}
```
newname.testfile copy.testfile
files documents newname.testfile
```
{: .output}

## Removing files

We've begun to clutter up our workspace with all of the directories and files we've been making. 
Let's learn how to get rid of them. 
One important note before we start... **when you delete a file on UNIX systems, they are gone *forever***. 
There is no "recycle bin" or "trash". 
Once a file is deleted, it is gone, never to return. 
So be *very* careful when deleting files.

Files are deleted with `rm file [moreFiles]`. To delete the `newname.testfile` in our current directory:
```
$ ls
$ rm newname.testfile
$ ls
```
{: .bash}
```
files Documents newname.testfile
files Documents
```
{: .output}

That was simple enough. 
Directories are deleted in a similar manner using `rmdir`.

```
$ ls
$ rmdir Documents
$ rmdir files
$ ls
```
{: .bash}
```
files Documents
rmdir: failed to remove `files/': Directory not empty
files
```
{: .output}

What happened? As it turns out, `rmdir` is unable to remove directories that
have stuff in them. To delete a directory and everything inside it, we will
use a special variant of `rm`, `rm -rf directory`. This is probably the
scariest command on UNIX- it will force delete a directory and all of its
contents without prompting. **ALWAYS** double check your typing before using
it... if you leave out the arguments, it will attempt to delete everything on
your file system that you have permission to delete. So when deleting
directories be very, very careful.

> ## What happens when you use `rm -rf` accidentally
>
> Steam is a major online sales platform for PC videogames with over 125 million users. 
> Despite this, it hasn't always had the most stable or error-free code.
>
> In January 2015, user kevyin on GitHub 
> [reported that Steam's Linux client had deleted every file on his computer](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/3671). 
> It turned out that one of the Steam programmers had added the following line: `rm -rf "$STEAMROOT/"*`. 
> Due to the way that Steam was set up, the variable `$STEAMROOT` was never initialized, meaning the statement evaluated to `rm -rf /*`. 
> This coding error in the Linux client meant that Steam deleted every single file on a computer when run in certain scenarios (including connected external hard drives). 
> Moral of the story: **be very careful** when using `rm -rf`!

## Looking at files

Sometimes it's not practical to read an entire file with `cat`- the file
might be way too large, take a long time to open, or maybe we want to only
look at a certain part of the file. As an example, we are going to look at a
large and complex file type used in bioinformatics- a .gtf file. The GTF2
format is commonly used to describe the location of genetic features in a
genome.

Let's grab and unpack a set of demo files for use later.
To do this, we'll use `wget` (`wget link` downloads a file from a link).
```
wget http://hpc-carpentry.github.io/hpc-intro/files/bash-lesson.tar.gz
```
{: .bash}

You'll commonly encounter `.tar.gz` archives while working in UNIX. 
To extract the files from a `.tar.gz` file, we run the command `tar -xvf filename.tar.gz`:

```
tar -xvf bash-lesson.tar.gz
```
{: .bash}
```
dmel-all-r6.19.gtf
dmel_unique_protein_isoforms_fb_2016_01.tsv
gene_association.fb
SRR307023_1.fastq
SRR307023_2.fastq
SRR307024_1.fastq
SRR307024_2.fastq
SRR307025_1.fastq
SRR307025_2.fastq
SRR307026_1.fastq
SRR307026_2.fastq
SRR307027_1.fastq
SRR307027_2.fastq
SRR307028_1.fastq
SRR307028_2.fastq
SRR307029_1.fastq
SRR307029_2.fastq
SRR307030_1.fastq
SRR307030_2.fastq
```

> ## Unzipping files
>
> We just unzipped a .tar.gz file for this example. What if we run into other file formats that we need to unzip? Just use the handy reference below:
>
> * `gunzip` unzips .gz files
> * `unzip` unzips .zip files
> * `unrar` unzips .rar files
> * `tar -xvf` unzips .tar.gz and .tar.bz2 files
{: .callout}

That is a lot of files!
One of these files, `dmel-all-r6.19.gtf` is extremely large,
and contains every annotated feature in the *Drosophila melanogaster* genome. 
It's a huge file- what happens if we run `cat` on it? (Press `Ctrl + C` to stop it).

So, `cat` is a really bad option when reading big files... 
it scrolls through the entire file far too quickly!
What are the alternatives? Try all of these out and see which ones you like best!

* `head file` - Print the top 10 lines in a file to the console. You can control the number of lines you see with the `-n numberOfLines` flag.

* `tail file` - Same as `head`, but prints the last 10 lines in a file to the console.

* `less file` - Opens a file and display as much as possible on-screen. You can scroll with `Enter` or the arrow keys on your keyboard. Press `q` to close the viewer. 

Out of `cat`, `head`, `tail, and `less`, which method of reading files is your favorite? Why?
