# Introduction to using the shell in a High-Performance Computing context

This lesson provides an introduction to the bash shell aimed at researchers who will be using
the command line to use remote, high-performance computing (HPC) systems. The material is also
suitable for teaching the use of the shell for any remote, advanced computing resources.


## Using this material

1. Follow the found in the [Software Carpentry example lesson source](https://github.com/carpentries/lesson-example/)
   to create a repository for your lesson.
2. Edit [_config.yml](_config.yml) to modify the configuration options at the bottom for the
   remote host you will be using. These options set such things as the address of the host
   to login to and the ID that is used to incorporate host-specific code snippets (see below).
3. Create the required host-specific code snippets in subdirectories in
   [_includes/snippets](_includes/snippets). These snippets provide inputs and outputs that 
   are host-specific and that are included automatically based on the configuration in the 
   `_config.yml` file.
   1. Code snippets are in files named `snippet_name.host_id` and are included automatically
      when the lesson is built. For example, if the `snippet_name` was `login_output` and the
     `host_id` was `ComputeCanada_Graham`, then the snippet file would be called
     `login_output.ComputeCanada_Graham`.
   2. Code snippets are placed in subdirectories that are named according to the episode they
      appear in. For example, if the snippet is for episode 01, then it will be in a 
      subdirectory called `01`.


## Lesson writing instructions

This is a fast overview of the Software Carpentry lesson template. This won't cover lesson style or
formatting (address that during review?).

For a full guide to the lesson template, see the
[Software Carpentry example lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/lesson-example/).

### Lesson structure

Software Carpentry lessons are generally episodic, with one clear concept for each episode
([example](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/)).

An episode is a markdown file that lives under the `_episodes` folder. Here is a link to a
[markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) with most
markdown syntax. Additionally, the Software Carpentry lesson template uses several extra bits of
formatting- see here for a [full guide](http://swcarpentry.github.io/lesson-example/04-formatting/).
The most significant change is the addition of a YAML header that adds metadata (key questions,
lesson teaching times, etc.) and special syntax for code blocks, exercises, and the like.

Episode names should be prefixed with a number of their section plus the number of their episode
within that section. This is important because the Software Carpentry lesson template will auto-post
our lessons in the order that they would sort in. As long as your lesson sorts into the correct
order, it will appear in the correct order on the website.

### Publishing changes to Github + the Github pages website

The lesson website is viewable at
[https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/hpc-shell/](https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/hpc-shell/)

The lesson website itself is auto-generated from the `gh-pages` branch of this repository. Github
pages will rebuild the website as soon as you push to the Github `gh-pages` branch. Because of this
`gh-pages` is considered the "master" branch.

### Previewing changes locally

Obviously having to push to Github every time you want to view your changes to the website isn't
very convenient. To preview the lesson locally, run `make serve`. You can then view the website at
`localhost:4000` in your browser. Pages will be automatically regenerated every time you write to
them.

Note that the autogenerated website lives under the `_site` directory (and doesn't get pushed to
Github).

This process requires Ruby, Make, and Jekyll. You can find setup instructions
[here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/lesson-example/setup/).
